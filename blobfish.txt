The blobfish is know as the world's ugliest animal. It is a deep sea fish that
lives off the coasts of Austrailia, Tasmania, and New Zealand. One fun fact
aboutthem is they don't have a swim bladder. If the blobfish did have a swim
bladder, then it would implode under the extreme pressure that they live in.
