Turtle's are really cool. There shell is a a defense mechanism and a shelter that goes around with them. They can lunge and snap too depending on the type. They are also seen in many cultures as a protector, wise and benevolent. Even Stephen King in his mythos has a turtle as a benevolent protector of the weak and fearful (you can see a LEGO turtle in Georgie's older brother's room in th efirst IT movie when Pennywise first appears).
